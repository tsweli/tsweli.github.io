    <h1>The Financialisation of Housing and Its Impact</h1>
    
    <p>There is no doubt that the commodification, through financialisation, of housing has displaced low- and middle-income earners from economically productive centers across the world. In my home country of South Africa, the issue is particularly complex due to spatial injustice entrenched not only by market forces through the financialisation of housing, but also by the country’s historical Apartheid-era legislative framework. This framework created segregated urban settlements primarily along racial lines; closely tied to income and class, therefore, it can be argued that the financialisation of housing has perpetuated segregated urban settlements.</p>

    <p>In this essay, I argue that the sort-of financialisation of housing discussed in the United Nations “Report of the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context” exacerbates issues of access to adequate housing, especially within economically productive urban centers. In the same breath, however, I argue that financialisation of housing is a powerful technology, of which when democratised, can be used to alleviate some of the pertinent issues faced by low- and middle-income earners.</p>

    <p>Financialisation is a mere technology which has made real-estate commodification much easier and extremely efficient by creating enough liquidity in the market to trade and speculate on housing prices. Commodification of real-estate in and of itself has always existed. In the 1870’s, there was a major shortage of housing for industrial workers in Germany, which led philosophers like Frederick Engels to propose: “abolition of the capitalist mode of production, is the solution of the housing question.” This was over-and-above, in critique to the Proudhonist viewpoint which was that: “it a crime against eternal justice that the house owner can without working, obtain ground rent and interest out of the capital he has invested in the house.”</p>

    <p>The views echoed here were that housing was not cherished as a social good, but a vehicle for profit, i.e. housing was commodified. The issues highlighted in the UN’s Special Rapporteur on adequate housing are fundamentally, issues relating to the commodification of housing, in particular: the exacerbation of inequality and social exclusion, the undermining of democratic governance and community accountability, the detaching of housing from its connection to community, human dignity, and security, as well as the lack of establishment of human rights accountability in the space.</p>

    <p>Susan Fainstein argues a similar point to mine, where she writes in her commentary titled Financialisation and Justice in The City:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>“My own view is that the recent intensifying of financialisation per se does not produce uneven development, since uneven development has always been a hallmark of real estate development under capitalism.”</p>
        <div class="author">Susan Fainstein</div>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Financialisation has made it easier for capital to flow into securities where returns are maximised and risk is minimised, this leads to increased positive speculation in securities tied to existing real-estate developments, e.g. productive city centers - outpricing local individuals who live and work in the city, but don’t necessarily speculate on the securities of real-estate therein. In pursuit of maximizing profits, this has, in some cases, even led to gentrification. This in turn enriches the haves, and takes away from the have-nots, further making socioeconomic mobility more difficult; entrenching inequality. In the case of my home country, this means entrenching the legacy of Apartheid.</p>

    <p>Financialisation, however, can be used as a tool for spatial justice across the world by leveraging the very power it allows for efficient commodification; which is that it makes real-estate more liquid. With this, capital can be pooled and directed to efforts of introducing affordable housing in economically productive centers. Capital flow into affordable developments needs to be incentivised by either making the associated securities less risky or more lucrative; this can be done in many ways, one way is through the backing of local governments.</p>

    <p>Financialisation in the form of crypto tokens can also be used to tokenize real-estate, giving fractional ownership to low-income renters, who could use this as collateral for a low-interest loan to help better their lives—such as putting their children in university, etc. This could also make it easier for “the man on the street” (not just “the man on Wall Street”) to also trade in real-estate, in the sense of building their own wealth and being able to hedge against property devaluation in their area as well.</p>
