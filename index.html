<h1> A Dead Heart Beats </h1>
A dead heart beats, <br>
a dadâ€™s heart beat, <br>
a deadbeat sleeps <br>
And what do the children eat.

<br><br>

A hollow bowl rolls, <br>
it tip taps on the weight of its edges <br>
Like a dead heart <br>
it beats. 

<br><br>

A dad's heart beats, <br>
a vision speaks <br>
a man sees, 
and the children eat. <br>
