<h1> A Dead Heart Beats </h1>
A dead heart beats, <br>
a dadâ€™s heart beat, <br>
a deadbeat sleeps <br>
And what do the children eat.

<br><br>

A hollow bowl rolls, <br>
it tip taps on the weight of its edges <br>
Like a dead heart <br>
it beats. 

<br><br>

A dad's heart beats <br>
A dad's heart beats <br>
A father sleeps.  <br>

A dad's heart beats, <br>
a vision speaks <br>
a man sees, 
and the children eat. <br> 


In The Myth Of Sisyphus: An Absurd Reasoning, A 28-year-old Albert Camus writes:
<i>
There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide. 
Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the 
fundamental question of philosophy. [...]. And if it is true, as Nietzsche claims,
that a philosopher, to deserve our respect, must preach by example, you can appreciate
the importance of that reply, for it will precede the definitive act. [...]
