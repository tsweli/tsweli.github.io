<header>Reclamation</header>
More often than not, I wake up with my forehead facing down the barrel of a gun with my finger on the trigger. 

Suicide, for me, has been like pulling the trigger of a sixgun loaded only with one bullet. Each time, my fate is an empty cylinder and like a cat with five lives, I rise again from my unclean linen. 

At least, for now, it’s a little more clean than one which would otherwise be soaked in my blood and perhaps some of the grey-matter and gue of my bullet.

Many rise to a day with only the resistance of air; the very air they breathe for sustenance. I wake up and half-rise to the resistance of knowing that I will never be. 

My soul will never be seen. Forever denied any form of expression except that which can be commodified. It can’t be counted alongside their beans. The very beans whose vines and bushes I share the same soul with.  

The violence of their rejection is the power I will resistant.

I imagine Sisyphus angry. I imagine his heart filled with envy for the gods. I imagine he rolls ha boulder up the hill with his fists clenched. He is angry at the power that has subjugated him to the violence he continuously lives.

In this world, we live among such gods. They wield power, not for humanity, but over humanity. 

There’s one more cylinder left in my sixgun and it is no longer facing my forehead. It is aimed at the gods who have graced us with their presence. The next morning, I pull the trigger. 

To the gods of this world, you cannot hurt me, because I have already accepted the hurt as the price of admission. Now, let’s see if you can survive me.
