  <h1>The Mirror That Shattered Was Never Mine</h1>
  <p><em>(A lamentation, an unmasking, a resurrection)</em></p>

  <h2>I. Invocation of Quiet Men</h2>
  <p>They say nothing is louder than the silence of a man<br>
  who listens without flinching—<br>
  whose love does not shout,<br>
  but simply remains.</p>
  <p>I stood, bare-palmed,<br>
  not armored in vengeance, not sculpted in flame,<br>
  but softened —<br>
  hands open like parentheses<br>
  to hold the weight of a story<br>
  you said you wanted me to hear.</p>
  <p>You spoke of ghosts,<br>
  and I did not interrupt the funeral procession.<br>
  I brushed my hand along your shoulder,<br>
  not to fix the wreckage,<br>
  but to say, "I see the house still smoldering. I will not walk away."</p>
  <p>But you did not want presence.<br>
  You wanted a war cry.</p>
  <p>You mistook quiet empathy<br>
  for the apathy of men<br>
  who cannot name sorrow without breaking things.</p>

  <h2>II. Where Guilt Was Passed Like Inheritance</h2>
  <p>You told me I made you feel small.<br>
  But it was not my voice that cast the shadow —<br>
  it was the architecture of your own shame.</p>
  <p>You held out riddles,<br>
  disguised them as conversations,<br>
  and when I did not solve them<br>
  in the exact cadence you imagined,<br>
  you punished me for being honest<br>
  instead of clairvoyant.</p>
  <p>I gave you every version of my heart<br>
  that language could stretch to hold.<br>
  I wrote essays for questions never truly asked,<br>
  offered metaphors in place of apologies I never owed,<br>
  sat inside guilt dressed in your perfume,<br>
  wondering if I was the one who had gone cold.</p>
  <p>But the fire was yours,<br>
  and I only ever tried to bring water.</p>

  <h2>III. The Inversion</h2>
  <p>You said I made you cut.<br>
  That I was cold.<br>
  That I did not carry your pain gently enough.<br>
  But I have walked through flame for you<br>
  while you watched from the shade,<br>
  wondering why I was sweating.</p>
  <p>You drank to speak to me.<br>
  You smoked to soften your own voice.<br>
  I gave up wine and you gave me disbelief—<br>
  as if sobriety were a betrayal<br>
  and not a boundary I bled to hold.</p>
  <p>And even in the parting,<br>
  you placed your sadness into my hands<br>
  as if I had carved it.</p>

  <h2>IV. The Chorus of Echoes</h2>
  <p>Your friends—not many stayed.<br>
  Your little sister-a mirror you couldn’t look into.<br>
  Your mother—a wound you called an enemy.</p>
  <p>I was merely next.</p>
  <p>The pattern was older than me—<br>
  I was just the most recent recipient<br>
  of your unfinished grief.</p>
  <p>I wanted to love you like a conversation,<br>
  but you wanted to be worshipped like an apology.</p>
  <p>You said, "Why didn’t you say what my father would say?"<br>
  And I replied, "Because I am not your father. I am not the war. I am not the sword."<br>
  But you didn’t hear that.<br>
  You only heard silence<br>
  where a performance should have been.</p>

  <h2>V. Resurrection in the Aftermath</h2>
  <p>I am not sorry for being gentle.<br>
  I am not sorry for being still.<br>
  I am not sorry for not screaming when you wanted thunder<br>
  or for not bleeding theatrics at your altar.</p>
  <p>I will not carry guilt for loving with integrity<br>
  simply because you were unfamiliar with quiet kindness.</p>
  <p>My hands were not empty —<br>
  they were holding presence, not spectacle.</p>
  <p>I leave you not because I lacked devotion,<br>
  but because I will no longer explain my softness<br>
  to people who only recognize love by the damage it leaves behind.</p>

  <h2>VI. Coda — Blackbird Ascending</h2>
  <p>Ahh—<br>
  I flew without wings, fell through flame,<br>
  and still I rise through the wreckage of your name.</p>
  <p>I bled for a silence you never heard,<br>
  sang for a love you never returned.</p>
  <p>Now I rise, unbound,<br>
  from the echo of your grief.<br>
  No chains left on my voice,<br>
  no weight left on my speech.</p>

  <div class="epilogue">
    <h2>Epilogue — The Sermon I Never Gave</h2>
    <p>She said,<br>
    "An ungodly man is a dealbreaker."</p>
    <p>And I listened.<br>
    Not to argue. Not to defend.<br>
    But to understand the altar she prayed at<br>
    and whether I was ever welcome to kneel there.</p>
    <p>So I opened my hands,<br>
    not with incense or scripture,<br>
    but with history —<br>
    a liturgy written in the margins of my life,<br>
    not in verses, but in scars.</p>
    <p>I brought her the essay,<br>
    the long hymn of my journey —<br>
    not toward her god,<br>
    but toward my own peace.</p>
    <p>And still, she called it betrayal.</p>
    <p>She did not want understanding.<br>
    She wanted exception.<br>
    She did not want a man to stand in his truth —<br>
    She wanted one to discard it quietly<br>
    for the comfort of her conditions.</p>
    <p>If godliness is the price of your affection,<br>
    then love was never the offering —<br>
    only a sermon dressed as safety.</p>
    <p>And I would rather walk alone,<br>
    unblessed but whole,<br>
    than bow in a place<br>
    that demands I abandon my soul.</p>
